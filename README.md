# BrainFunctional
Another Brainfuck derivative. But also so much more.

Do you love brainfuck but also never use it because you value your braincells? Well worry not, the solution to all your problems is here.

We bring to you simple, scalable brainfuck! Ok no. That was a lie to get your attention. But it worked didn't it? I mean if you're reading this it either worked or you're mentally deranged. Probably from too much brainfuck. That is a problem we will fix.

## What is it?
Brainfuck but with functions.

If you have no idea what brainfuck is but for some reason are still reading this, here is a [wikepedia article]([url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck)) explaining the fundamentals of the esoteric programming language. I will not be exploring how to use brainfuck or going over it in this guide, so if you don't understand some of the examples given or want another guide on the language, here is a [tutorial]([url](https://gist.github.com/roachhd/dce54bec8ba55fb17d3a)) by @roachhd, which covers some of the fundamentals quite well.

The syntax is minimalistic, simple and impractical, following the fundamentals of the language.

However, unlike many features of brainfuck, it is a powerful and versatile tool which makes the language more high level. Not a lot more, but it actually allows you to solve more complex problems with brainfuck, in a style that is still quintessential brainfuck. Not brainfucking bad if I'd say so myself.

So let's jump into the syntax.

## Defining a Function
Functions are wrapped with curly brackets: `{}`
